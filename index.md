<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;">Welcome!</h2>

<p>
I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/earth/" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a>. 
My research focuses on the evolution of plate tectonics, with particular interests in both long-term tectonic deformation and short-term earthquake simulation.
</p>

<p>
My areas of expertise include:
<ul>
  <li>The opening and closure of mid-ocean ridges</li>
  <li>Subduction zone destruction</li>
  <li>Earthquake cycle simulation</li>
  <li>Frictional laws and their applications</li>
  <li>Grain size reduction mechanisms</li>
  <li>Advanced numerical modeling techniques</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I earned my PhD in Geodynamics from <a href="https://gfd.ethz.ch/" target="_blank">ETH Zurich</a>, where I developed extensive expertise in numerical simulations.
